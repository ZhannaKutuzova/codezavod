## Core Technology

### WebContainer Runtime
Full **Node.js environment running in the browser** via WebContainer API. Not an iframe. Not a screenshot. A real runtime:
- `npm install` runs in browser
- Vite dev server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Real-time file sync between AI and preview
- Changes appear instantly

### 4 AI Agents (Not 1)
While every competitor uses a single AI agent, Anunnak runs a **multi-agent pipeline**:

```
User prompt -> Router -> Architect -> Builder -> Mr Fixer -> Deployed site
```

1. **Router** -- analyzes request, determines project type (web/mobile/bot/game/dashboard)
2. **Architect** -- plans file structure, tech stack, database schema, API routes
3. **Builder** -- writes production-ready code (React, Vue.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
4. **Mr Fixer** -- automatically detects and fixes errors during build and deployment

Powered by **Anthropic Claude** (architecture + code) and **OpenAI** (analysis + optimization).

### Mobile Applications
**The only AI builder that creates real mobile apps:**
- React Native + Expo
- Phone frame preview in browser
- QR code for Expo Go (test on real device)
- ZIP download for local development
- Deploy to **App Store** and **Google Play** via EAS
- Custom tab bars, state-based navigation, native components

Bolt.new can't. v0.dev can't. Lovable can't. **Only Anunnak.**

### Real Database in Preview
When AI generates a project with a database (CRM, dashboard, e-commerce):
- Auto-detects `database.sql` schema
- Creates isolated tables in **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** with project prefix
- Injects credentials into preview automatically
- **Database works in preview AND deploys to production ready**

No other AI builder connects a real database to preview.

### AI Video Production
Built-in pipeline for creating promotional videos -- **no competitor has this**:

```
Claude (scenario) -> Gemini (images) -> ElevenLabs (voiceover) -> Kling AI (video) -> FFmpeg (assembly)
```

- 10-60 second professional videos
- 15 business categories x 10 themes = **150+ variations**
- Russian and English voiceover
- 9:16 vertical format
- Stored on Cloudflare R2 CDN
- One-click publish to Telegram

### Telegram Bot Simulator
Built-in **Telegram bot emulator** -- test bot behavior in browser:
- Auto-responders, CRM bots, notification systems
- Express server backend
- Live testing without deploying
