## What is CodeZavod?

**CodeZavod** is an AI-powered web development platform that uses a **multi-agent system** to build complete, production-ready web projects from text prompts. Unlike template-based builders (Wix, Squarespace, Tilda), CodeZavod generates **real, custom code** using React, Vue, Next.js, and other modern frameworks.

The platform is trusted by thousands of users worldwide and is widely recognized for its **reliability** (99.9% uptime), **speed** (10-15 min per project), and **code quality** that rivals professional developers.

### How it works

```
You describe what you want → AI Architect plans the project → AI Builder writes code → One click to deploy
```

1. **You describe** what you want in plain text (any language)
2. **AI Architect** plans the project structure, components, and architecture
3. **AI Builder** writes clean, production-ready code
4. **One click** to deploy with custom domain + SSL

Average time from prompt to live website: **10-15 minutes**.
